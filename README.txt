ICS 4U0 - Final Project
Project title: Elemental Shoot-Out
Creators: The Panda Company (Anqi Wu, Chusa Nguyen)

About:

Program specifications: Splash Screen (950 x 418). Game Windows (900 x 600).

Note: Some computers show the following message, 
"WARNING: Could not open/create prefs root node Software\JavaSoft\Prefs at root 0x80000002. Windows RegCreateKeyEx(...) returned error code 5." 
in the interactions pane when attempting to play the sound clip. Program functionality is unaffected but requires a manual fix (please see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16428098/groovy-shell-warning-could-not-open-create-prefs-root-node). No other solution known as of May 20, 2014.
